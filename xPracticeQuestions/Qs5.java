/*
 * Design and implement a java program that simulates a network monitoring system.
 * Your system should be capable of monitoring different types of network devices, such as
 * routers and switches, and alerting if any devices are experiencing errors or downtime.
 * Use interfaces to define common behaviours for network devices and implement these behaviours in different device classes.
 * 
 * Create an interface named NetworkDevice with atleast two methods:
 * 
 * - getStatus() which returns a String indicating the current status of device
 * - isAvailable() which returns a boolean indicating if the device is currently available and functioning correctly.
 * 
 * Implement the NetworkDevice interface in at least three seperate classes, Router and Switch. Each class should have a 
 * constructor that sets specific properties for the device and specific logic to determine its status and availability
